This folder contains the files for Assignment 12 from the class ECE 0301, 
  Problem Solving with C++.

Unfortunately, I do not have the file containing the assignment description,
  however, each file should contain an inividual file description.

Each sub folder contains the submission requirements for certain steps in the
  assignment. Only certain steps require submission, and some of the programs
  may be copies from previous steps, or amended copies from previous steps.

All ".cpp" and ".h" files within each sub folder were created by myself in 
  order to fulfill requirements for the project.
