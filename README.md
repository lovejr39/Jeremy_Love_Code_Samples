# Jeremy_Love_Code_Samples

This is a GitHub Repository meant to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of coding languages. 

It contains various projects, labs, and assignments from different classes throughout both high school and college. 

I continue to add to this repository over time as I expand my knowledge and further solidify my skills.

Each folder contains samples from the coding language indicated in the folder name. 

The "README.md" file in each folder contains more information.
