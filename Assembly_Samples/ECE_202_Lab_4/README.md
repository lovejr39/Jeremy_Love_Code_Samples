This folder contains the files for Lab 3: "Keypad Scanning (in assembly)" 
  for the class ECE 0202, Embedded Processors and Interfacing.

All files within this folder are a part of the lab template given in order
  to complete the lab via the usage of an STM32 Nucleo-64 Development
  Board with STM32L476RG MCU and Keil uVision software.

The relevant lab description and homework submission is within the file 
  "Lab_4_Description_and_Submission.pdf".

The portions of code writen and edited for the lab are within the file 
  "Lab4_Template/Lab4_Template/main.s". The other files were given as 
  part of the lab template.

Even though this was a group lab submission, it is still a worthy sample to
  represent my proficiency in Assembly.
