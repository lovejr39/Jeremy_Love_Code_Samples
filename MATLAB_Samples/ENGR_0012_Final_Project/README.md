This folder contains the files for my final project from ENGR 0012, 
  Introduction to Engineering Computing.

Even though this project was a group project, it is still a great 
  representation of my growing proficiency in MATLAB. I am planning on 
  correcting the minor errors in the code to better represent my individual 
  abilites, but I have not done this yet.

All files within this folder were created by my group for the project and the
  whole project should function properly.

The project description is below.

Please use the file "PittGymDriver.m" to run the program.

ENGR 12 - Final Project

Problem Statement:

Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, normal life as we 
  knew it was disrupted. One of the challenges that was facing the 
  University of Pittsburgh was to adapt a modified system that will allow 
  for the use of indoor recreational facilities, while maintaining social 
  distancing practices and safety measures. Your goal in this project is 
  to design a software program to help Pitt operate any of the gym 
  facilities on campus efficiently, and still follow the CDC protocols for 
  social distancing and creating a safe environment inside the gym.

Purpose:

This software can target this problem from any aspect you see fit, the 
  choice is completely yours! 

Useful Notes:

1.) Have fun!
2.) Work as a group:  The brainstorming process of how to solve a problem 
      is incredibly important when you are solving an engineering problem!  
3.) Make sure that you meet all of the criteria of the assignment when you 
      are solving this objective.
4.) Start Early!
5.) Help each other: This is a group objective! If you are having trouble 
      with a section of code reach out to your group members and have 
      problem solving sessions to determine how to manage these 
      difficulties. A different perspective can be incredibly helpful!

Comments: “Nice work Jeremy! There were a few minor errors in code. I 
  believe you accidentally used C coding language within your MATLAB code. 
  This appears to be the root of the minor errors. Aside from that code ran 
  smoothly and was formatted quite well. Nice work!”
